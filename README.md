# DnD-Calculator
A custom calculator for a mechanic in one of my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.

For one of my campaigns, me and the other player became gods by getting people to worship us. However, the rate at which they converted other people, and the rate at which people decided that they thought we were fake gods who needed to be destroyed, was something we needed to calculate repeatedly, so I made a calculator to streamline the process. Because we would recalculate it several times per session, it loops on itself using the stored values from the last iteration to help calculate the next one.
